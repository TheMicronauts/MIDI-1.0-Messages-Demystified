# MIDI 1.0 Messages Demystified

The resources in this repo untangle the essentials of the MIDI 1.0 standard for beginner musicians and aspiring instrument makers.

The mental model is that of a musician-producer who uses MIDI to play and write music. To my peers and me, it functions a real-time notation language of both the score and its interpretation, grounded in music theory, and intelligible to both humans and machines. 

I encourage developers to approach MIDI with this mindset if they want to avoid writing wonky programs that are hostile to musical practice and culture.
